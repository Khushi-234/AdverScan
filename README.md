## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerized run)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/AdverScan.git
   cd AdverScan
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment & install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   make dev-install
   ```

3. **Run the API server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.api.main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Run via Docker:**
   ```bash
   make docker-up
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

AdverScan provides module interfaces for:
1. **Ingesting** target models and datasets.
2. **Executing** targeted adversarial attacks.
3. **Evaluating & Scoring** robustness metrics.
4. **Hardening** model checkpoints against adversarial perturbations.
5. **Generating** explainability visualizers and audit reports.
